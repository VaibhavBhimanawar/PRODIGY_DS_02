Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning & EDA
This project demonstrates data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify trends, and gain insights into survival outcomes.

Steps in the Project
Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked).
Encoded categorical variables (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
Dropped irrelevant features (Ticket, Name).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed survival rates by Sex, Pclass, and Age.
Visualized data with histograms, boxplots, and heatmaps.
Identified correlations between variables like Fare and survival.
Key Insights
Gender: Females had a higher survival rate (around 74%) than males (19%).
Ticket Class: Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.
Age: Younger passengers, especially children, had better survival chances.
Fare: Higher ticket fares correlated with higher survival rates.
Conclusion
The analysis highlights significant factors that influenced survival on the Titanic, such as gender, class, and fare. This foundation can be extended for predictive modeling or deeper feature engineering.
